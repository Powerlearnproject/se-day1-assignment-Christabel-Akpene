Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles, methods and tools that can be used to produce high quality software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines. The importance of software in the technology industry is that it allows efficient softwares to be developed.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The introduction of high level programming languages - High level languages such as FORTRAN, COBOL made coding more accessible and easy to understand with compliers conveting high level progrmming language to machine language.
2. The introduction of devops and ci/cd pipeline - This streamlines the time and processes involved in getting code into production with automated testing, integration and development of code.
3. Cloud computing and ai - There is the integration of ai and cloud computing in software development now. This makes it more convenient for larger softwares to be built with little cost.
 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. User needs and expectations are to be gathered. The requirements of the user should first be gathered.
2. Analysis- Problem statement is developed based on the user requirements.
3. Design phase- The software requirement of the user is designed.
4. Implementation phase - The design of the software is implemented.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall method is a linear approach where each phase of the project is completed before moving on to the next. It is highly structured with specific deliveries and making changes to the project is difficult while with agile method, the project is divided into smaller iterations, with each iteration being a potentially viable product. It embraces changes throughout the project lifecycle. Waterfall method would be useful for projects with clear requirements and also for large and complex projects whereas the agile method would be useful for projects with changing requirements and for smaller projects.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes code and develops the whole software. The quality assurance engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before it is deployed and the software works according to its requirements and the project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the software development project, ensuring that it is completed on time, within budget, and meets the agreed-upon requirements.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is software that combines commonly used developer tools into a compact GUI application. It is a combination of tools like a code editor, code compiler, and code debugger with an integrated terminal.By providing frequently used developer tools all in one simple interface, one can directly get on to building their applications without going through the hardship of manually configuring and integrating the development environment. E.g: Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, Pycharm
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code. It reduces the possibilities of errors since one can revert to older changes and it allows a group of developers to work on one project simultaneously. E.g Git, mercurial, bitbucket

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
