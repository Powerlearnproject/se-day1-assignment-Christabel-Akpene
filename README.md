#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles, methods and tools that can be used to produce high quality software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines. The importance of software in the technology industry is that it allows efficient softwares to be developed.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The introduction of high level programming languages - High level languages such as FORTRAN, COBOL made coding more accessible and easy to understand with compliers conveting high level progrmming language to machine language.
2. The introduction of devops and ci/cd pipeline - This streamlines the time and processes involved in getting code into production with automated testing, integration and development of code.
3. Cloud computing and ai - There is the integration of ai and cloud computing in software development now. This makes it more convenient for larger softwares to be built with little cost and stress.
 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. User needs and expectations are to be gathered. The requirements of the user should first be gathered.
2. Analysis- Problem statement is developed based on the user requirements.
3. Design phase- The software requirement of the user is designed.
4. Implementation phase - The design of the software is implemented.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall method is a linear approach where each phase of the project is completed before moving on to the next. It is highly structured with specific deliveries and making changes to the project is difficult while with agile method, the project is divided into smaller iterations, with each iteration being a potentially viable product. It embraces changes throughout the project lifecycle. Waterfall method would be useful for projects with clear requirements and also for large and complex projects whereas the agile method would be useful for projects with changing requirements and for smaller projects.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer writes code and develops the whole software. 
The quality assurance engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before it is deployed and the software works according to its requirements.
The project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the software development project, ensuring that it is completed on time, within budget, and meets the agreed-upon requirements.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An IDE is software that combines commonly used developer tools into a compact GUI application. It is a combination of tools like a code editor, code compiler, and code debugger with an integrated terminal.By providing frequently used developer tools all in one simple interface, one can directly get on to building their applications without going through the hardship of manually configuring and integrating the development environment. E.g: Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, Pycharm
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code. It reduces the possibilities of errors since one can revert to older changes and it allows a group of developers to work on one project simultaneously. E.g Git, mercurial, bitbucket

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Complexity - Some software systems have become increasingly complex, making it difficult for developers to understand and manage all the components of a system. This can be resolved by breaking down components into smaller units and writing clean code.
2. Meeting Deadlines: Developers often work under tight deadlines, which can make it difficult to ensure the quality of the final product. This can be solved by priotising tasks, breaking down work into smaller units and setting specific time for specific work.
3. Evolving requirements - The requirements of a particular software may evolve rapidly which can disrupt established workflows and complicate team dynamics as engineers scramble to adapt their work to the new demands. This can be solved by implementing agile methodologies, which prioritize iterative development and regular feedback which can help teams manage evolving requirements more effectively.
4. Debugging -  Identifying and fixing bugs can be time-consuming, especially in large, complex systems. This can be solved by implementing robust testing frameworks and practices, such as automated testing and code reviews, can reduce the frequency and severity of bugs, allowing teams to focus more on proactive development.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is a software testing technique in which individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation. These units are the smallest pieces of code, typically functions or methods, ensuring they perform as expected. Unit testing helps in identifying bugs early in the development cycle, enhancing code quality, and reducing the cost of fixing issues later.

Integration testing is the process of testing how different modules or components of your software work together. Integration tests can help to reduce development time and cost by catching issues early in the development process.

System testing evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution. It is performed to ensure that the system meets the specified requirements of the software and is suitable for delivery to end-users. 

Acceptance testing is testing according to user needs, requirements, and business processes and it is conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria or not and to enable the users, customers, or other authorized entities to determine whether to accept the system or not. User acceptance testing is used to determine whether the product is working for the user correctly.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of creating effective prompts that enable AI models to generate responses based on given inputs. Prompt engineering helps generative AI models better comprehend and respond to a wide range of queries. Generative AI relies on the iterative refinement of different prompt engineering techniques to effectively learn from diverse input data and adapt to minimize biases, confusion and produce more accurate responses. By fine-tuning effective prompts, engineers can significantly optimize the quality and relevance of outputs to solve for both the specific and the general.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - Tell me about history.
Improved prompt - Give me an overview of the history of the Roman Empire.
The first prompt may lead to a broad and unfocused answer while the second prompt gives a more focused and relevant answer.
